# Why we need Sprint 0
- Align everyone
- Setup tech, environment, and ways of working
- Reduce risks before real development starts
- > Make the Sprint 1 smooth and predictable
  
# What you should do / ask as a dev
- Ask about tech stack, architecture, standards
- Check env setup, repo, CI/CD readiness


# Sprint & Planning

“What should be ready before Sprint 1 starts?”


# Tech & Dev Setup

- “What tech stack are we using?”
- “Is there an existing architecture or design?”
- “Is the repo and branch strategy already decided?”

All meetings must have a clear agenda
This helps everyone understand the purpose of the meeting, 
prepare some necessary document in advance, 
stay focused on the right topics, and avoid wasting time.

Run unit tests regularly in the local environment
Developers should run unit tests before pushing or merging code to catch issues early, reduce bugs in shared branches, and keep the codebase stable for the whole team.
