# Project Context

1. Domain Overview

- Project is related to medical imaging (DICOM)
  - system work with DICOM file (CT, MRI, X-ray)
  - It uses OHIF Viewer as a web-based DICOM viewer
  - The viewer follows a zero-footprint approach (mean it does not modify the original DICOM file)

2. Current Epic: SP0293

- purpose: replace the existing viewer and server (technical infrastructure replace) [*]
- important:
  - first: focus on technical migration
  - it is not tied to any specific business requirement
  - the gap requirement will be addressed after the SP0293 is completed

3. Current Phase

- in a infrastructure replacement phase:
  - replace or upgrading the OHIF Viewer
  - replace or updating the related server component
- ensure technical foundation is modernize and stable before implementing additional business features

4. Know Concerns / Context from Discussions

- There has been some confusion regarding
  - whether the viewer is just technical migration step
  - or it is expected fully meet business requirement
  - There is concern that stakeholders may misunderstand the scope of the current phase.

# Key point I need to understand as a New Developer

- SP0293 is primarily a **technical migration effort**
- current viewer may not fully satisfy all documented business requirements
- Full requirement alignment is planned for a later phase
- The system involve DICOM, OHIF viewer and related to server components
- Demo session may occur, so the scope clarity is important

# Question can ask

## Scope & Architecture

- What exactly is being replaced in the SP0293? what is exactly the scope of the epic SP0293 (viewer version, framework, configuration, server technology)?
- what is the "replace server" mean changing the DICOM backend, API layer, or infrastructure hosting?
- Are there any breaking changes introduced by the new viewer or server

## Requirements

- Which requirements are considered in-scope for SP0293?
- Which requirements are intentionally out-og-scope for this phase? [new-or-gap-requirement]
- Are there defined acceptance criteria for the migration phase?

## Technical Understanding

- How does the viewer currently retrieve DICOM data? (DICOMweb, DICOM Cloud, custom API)
- What are the main technical risks in this migration?
- What is the current technical stack of the server? then we want to replace with OHIF
