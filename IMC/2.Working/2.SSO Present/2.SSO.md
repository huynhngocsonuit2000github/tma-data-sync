# Requirement 
They plan to stop using Auth0 and instead use Azure Entra (Azure AD) for authentication, mainly to reduce costs and because it’s already supported more widely within ICON.
-> Analyze 
  - Replace Auth0 with Azure Entra:
    - Stop using Auth0 as the Identity Provider
    - Use Azure Entra ID / Entra External ID instead of login + tokens
  - For cost savings:
    - No extra Auth0 license
    - Use identity that's already included in Microsoft / Azure plan
  - Broader Icon support:
    - Supports more enterprise identiy providers: 
      - Azure AD: internal employees
      - Active Directory: on-prem via sync
      - Microsoft accounts
      - Google, Fakebook, Apple (B2C / External ID)
      - SAML, OIDC, LDAP
        - Easy to integrate with corporate SSO

# Definition
- OAuth2 - Permission: let the app call APIs securely
- OpenID Connect — Login: let users log in
- Auth0 - Login system (service): handle login for you. login screen, stores users, issue tokens (OAuth2 + OIDC), handle MFA, password rules
- Azure Entra ID - Company Login system: **same job as Auth0**, but:
  - Owned by Microsoft
  - Already used by company
  - Integrate with Azure & Microsoft tools
  - > Azure Entra ID = company’s built-in login system
## Why replace Auth0 with Azure Entra
- Cost:
  - Auth0 = extra license
  - Azure Entra = Often included with Microsoft 365/ Azure subscription
- Enterprise integration
  - Native integration with Azure, Microsoft 365, DevOps, AKS, APIM
  - Built-in MFA, Conditional Access, Identity Protection
- Centralized identity
  - One identity system for employees, apps, APIs
  - No duplicated user management
  
# What is the same (technical flow)
- OAuth2 / OpenID Connect
  - OAuth2: app ask token, use that Access token to call another API (do not know the who user is)
  - OpenID Connect: user to login with Google, then Google return the ID Token (Authentication - login)
