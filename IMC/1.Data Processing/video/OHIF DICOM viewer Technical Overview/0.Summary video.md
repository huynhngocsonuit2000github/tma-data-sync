# Introduction / Context setting

- introduce OHIF viewer
- explain this is the web-based DICOM viewer
- Emphasize zero-footprint concept
- Mention DICOMweb/ cloud-based access
  -> overview, technically viewer

# Architecture / Technical Setup

Explain

- how viewer connect to server
- how to retrieve DICOM study (basically, it will get via DICOM Web APIs like QIDO / WADO)
- Structure study -> series -> instance
- not store the file in local (stateless / zero footprint)
  -> architecture system

# Study Query & Loading Flow

- How to query the list of study
- Select the study
- Load image into viewer
- Rendering process
  -> technical workflow of viewer

# Viewer Functionalities

- View image
- Zoom / pan
- Apply filter
- Possibly window / level adjustment
- switching series

-> functional capability demo, technical level

# Zero Footprint Explanation

Emphasize:

- Viewer not modify DICOM or original file
- Only render and interact at the client side
  -> important concept of the system

# Deployment / Environment Notes

- Local and server setup
- Endpoint configuration
- Cloud integration
  -> Infrastructure-related content

# The important thing is not in the transcript

There is no:

- The specific business requirement document mapping
- Acceptance criteria
- Gap analysis
- Feature validation checklist
- Confirmation with MS/OPs workflow
  -> It is just the technical showcase
  -> it is not requirement validation session

# Summary

- Overview OHIF
- Architecture explanation
- DICOM retrieval flow
- Viewer functionalities demo
- Zero-footprint explanation
- Infrastructure notes
